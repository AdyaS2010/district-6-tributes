# Context

Bro, your tributes are dying. They need a home base. They need a place to retreat to. They need an escape room. 

Your District has had two weeks to bond with each other and get to know each other. Take it to the next level by designing your own personal space!

# Your Task

In this challenge, you and your District will be coding and creating your own interactive personal District website. Make a tribute homepage, add stats, progress in the arena, leaderboard takeovers, etc. Be creative with it (this challenge will be heavily weighted in creativity points!), and you are required to add at least 3 Easter eggs that connect or correlate in some way with the concept(s) youâ€™ve learned during camp.

# Website Requirements

- A creative homepage/landing
- Introduction and overview of all members of the team 
- 3 Easter eggs related to scientific concepts learned during camp
- Escape room-esque elements
- A clear, uniting theme
